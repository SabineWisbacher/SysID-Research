  abstract = {This work develops methods to identify parametric models of nonlinear dynamic systems from response measurements using tools for Linear Time Periodic (LTP) systems. The basic approach is to drive the system periodically in a stable limit cycle and then measure deviations of the response from that limit cycle. Under certain conditions, the resulting response can be well approximated as that of a linear-time periodic system. In the analytical realm it is common to linearize a system about a periodic trajectory and then use Floquet analysis to assess the stability of the limit cycle. This work is concerned with the inverse problem, using a measured time-periodic response to derive a nonlinear dynamic model for the system. Recently, a few new methods were developed that facilitate the experimental identification of linear time periodic systems, and those methods are exploited in this work. The proposed system identification methodology is evaluated by applying it to a Duffing oscillator, demonstrating that the nonlinear force-displacement relationship can be identified without a priori knowledge of its functional form. The proposed methods are also applied to simulated measurements from a cantilever beam with a cubic nonlinear spring on its tip, revealing that the model order of the system and the displacement dependent stiffness can be readily identified.},

  abstract = {A variety of systems can be faithfully modeled as linear with coefficients that vary periodically with time or linear time-periodic (LTP). Examples include anisotropic rotor-bearing systems, wind turbines, and nonlinear systems linearized about a periodic trajectory. Many of these have been treated analytically in the literature, yet few methods exist for experimentally characterizing LTP systems. This paper presents a set of tools that can be used to identify a parametric model of a LTP system, using a frequency-domain approach and employing existing algorithms to perform parameter identification. One of the approaches is based on lifting the response to obtain an equivalent linear time-invariant (LTI) form and the other based is on Fourier series expansion. The development focuses on the preprocessing steps needed to apply LTI identification to the measurements, the postprocessing needed to reconstruct the LTP model from the identification results, and the interpretation of the measurements. This elucidates the similarities between LTP and LTI identification, allowing the experimentalist to transfer insight between the two. The approach determines the model order of the system and the postprocessing reveals the shapes of the time-periodic functions comprising the LTP model. Further postprocessing is also presented, which allows one to generate the state transition and time-varying state matrices of the system from the output of the LTI identification routine, so long as the measurement set is adequate. The experimental techniques are demonstrated on simulated measurements from a Jeffcott rotor mounted on an anisotropic flexible shaft supported by anisotropic bearings.},

  abstract = {In this paper, asymptotically unbiased subspace algorithms for the identification of bilinear systems are developed. Two three-block subspace algorithms are developed for the deterministic system case and two four-block ones for the combined deterministic-stochastic case. The input signal to the system does not have to be white, which is a major advantage over an existing subspace method for bilinear systems. All the identification algorithms give asymptotically unbiased estimates with general inputs, and the rate of reduction of bias with block size is estimated. Simulation results show that the new algorithms converge much more rapidly (with sample size) than existing methods, and hence are more effective with small sample sizes. The faster convergence is presumably due to the insensitivity of the algorithms to the samplespectrum of the input signal. These advantages are achieved by a new arrangement of the input-output equations into ‘blocks’, and projections onto different spaces than the ones used in earlier methods. A further advantage of our algorithms is that the dimensions of the matrices involved are significantly smaller, so that the computational complexity is lower, though still large.},

  abstract = {Aircraft system identification has a five-decades-long tradition at German Aerospace Center (DLR). Over the last two decades, the research covered various topics related to system identification of fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft, nonconventional applications and atmospheric effects, the development of new flight-test procedures for system identification purposes, and specific aircraft model enhancements and corresponding parameter estimation. Comprehensive tools were developed that support this research and can be applied to a variety of different problems and types of vehicles. The paper starts with a short description of the different system identification methods used at DLR and the corresponding tools. The discussion of flight-test procedures and maneuver design as well as sensor fusion and flight-path reconstruction provides information on how to optimize the flight tests for system identification and to arrive at a consistent flight-test database. The examples for fixed-wing aircraft provide information on identification including abnormal conditions such as icing and interaction with atmospheric disturbances as well as modeling of structural mechanics and loads. The identification of high-order rotorcraft models that account for rotor and engine dynamics and even structural modes is discussed, and the identification of rotor mast moments as well as the identification of non-physics-based models and their integration into physics-based models are also covered. A final section shows that system identification can also be used to derive models for gyroplanes and parachutes as well as to derive control equivalent turbulence input models and to estimate complex wind field geometries. Thus, a broad overview of possible applications of system identification is given.},

  abstract = {A rotorcraft is a class of aircraft that uses large-diameter rotating wings to accomplish efficient vertical take-off and landing. The class encompasses helicopters of numerous configurations (single main rotor and tail rotor, tandem rotors, coaxial rotors), tilting proprotor aircraft, compound helicopters, and many other innovative configuration concepts. Aeromechanics covers much of what the rotorcraft engineer needs: performance, loads, vibration, stability, flight dynamics, and noise. These topics include many of the key performance attributes and the often-encountered problems in rotorcraft designs. This comprehensive book presents, in depth, what engineers need to know about modelling rotorcraft aeromechanics. The focus is on analysis, and calculated results are presented to illustrate analysis characteristics and rotor behaviour. The first third of the book is an introduction to rotorcraft aerodynamics, blade motion, and performance. The remainder of the book covers advanced topics in rotary wing aerodynamics and dynamics.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a novel multi-input multi-output (MIMO) identification tool is proposed for linear time-periodic (LTP) mechanical systems based on a left matrix fraction description. The left matrix fraction parameterization has the advantage that nonlinear mechanical parameters, such as nonlinear damping and stiffness matrices, follow directly from the estimated MIMO LTP model. The algorithm starts from the Fourier decomposition of the equation of motion. Following a total least squares (TLS) approach, the identified Fourier harmonics of the nonlinear mechanical parameters are obtained from a single broadband experiment using a singular value decomposition. We show that the TLS estimator performs quite well on noisy data. The TLS scheme is illustrated on a 2-DoF mechanical rotor supported by nonlinear fluid film bearings under periodically varying loading conditions.},

Such assumption may be misleading for stability analysis, especially, with the current development of very large wind turbines with complex dynamic behavior (nonlinearity, aeroelastic coupling). Therefore in this paper, the inherent periodically time-varying dynamics of wind turbines (and for rotating systems, in general) is taken into account. Recently a subspace algorithm for modal analysis of rotating systems has been proposed. It is tested on a simulated and real data from a wind turbine.},

  abstract = {Accurate linear helicopter models are needed for control system development and simulation and can be determined by system identification when appropriate test data are available. Standard methods for rotorcraft system identification are the frequency domain maximum likelihood method and the frequency response method that are used to derive physics-based linear state-space models. Also the optimized predictor-based subspace identification method (PBSIDopt), a time domain system identification method that yields linear black box state-space models, has been successfully applied to rotorcraft data. As both methods have their respective strengths and weaknesses, it was tried to combine both techniques. The paper demonstrates the successful complementary use of physics-based frequency domain methods and the black box PBSIDopt method in the areas of database requirements, accuracy metrics, and model structure development using flight test data of DLR’s ACT/FHS research rotorcraft.},

  abstract = {System identification methodology is developed for a linear time-periodic (LTP) system and applied to an experimental setup of an integrally twist-actuated helicopter rotor blade. Identification is conducted for a controller design, which alleviates vibratory loads induced in forward flight. Since a rotor in forward flight is a time-periodic system due to the aerodynamic environment varying once per rotation, the adopted methodology requires determination of the multicomponent harmonic transfer functions. A simplified identification formula is also derived for a linear time-invariant (LTI) system, such as a rotor system in hover. The latter approach gives another estimate of the primary component among the harmonic transfer functions. The identification experiment is conducted at NASA Langley Transonic Dynamics Tunnel. The magnitude of the higher-order harmonic transfer functions is observed to be small in the frequency range of interest when compared with that of the primary component. This indicates that the present active rotor system may be regarded as a LTI system under the level flight conditions considered. Results obtained in system identification are interpreted in terms of the closed-loop controller design.},

  abstract = {A common approach to understanding and controlling robotic legged locomotion is the construction and analysis of simplified mathematical models that capture essential features of locomotor behaviours. However, the representational power of such simple mathematical models is inevitably limited due to the non-linear and complex nature of biological locomotor systems. Attempting to identify and explicitly incorporate key non-linearities into the model is challenging, increases complexity, and decreases the analytic utility of the resulting models. In this paper, we adopt a data-driven approach, with the goal of furnishing an input–output representation of a locomotor system. Our method is based on approximating the hybrid dynamics of a legged locomotion model around its limit cycle as a Linear Time Periodic (LTP) system. Perturbing inputs to the locomotor system with small chirp signals yield the input–output data necessary for the application of LTP system identification techniques, allowing us to estimate harmonic transfer functions (HTFs) associated with the local LTP approximation to the system dynamics around the limit cycle. We compare actual system responses with responses predicted by the HTF, providing evidence that data-driven system identification methods can be used to construct models for locomotor behaviours.},

  abstract = {Filtering and system identification are powerful techniques for building models of complex systems. This 2007 book discusses the design of reliable numerical methods to retrieve missing information in models derived using these techniques. Emphasis is on the least squares approach as applied to the linear state-space model, and problems of increasing complexity are analyzed and solved within this framework, starting with the Kalman filter and concluding with the estimation of a full model, noise statistics and state estimator directly from the data. Key background topics, including linear matrix algebra and linear system theory, are covered, followed by different estimation and identification methods in the state-space model. With end-of-chapter exercises, MATLAB simulations and numerous illustrations, this book will appeal to graduate students and researchers in electrical, mechanical and aerospace engineering. It is also useful for practitioners. Additional resources for this title, including solutions for instructors, are available online at www.cambridge.org/9780521875127.},

  abstract = {In this paper, the optimized predictor-based subspace identification (PBSIDopt) method is applied to identify linear models of DLR’s research helicopter ACT/FHS and to evaluate its usage to enhance existing physics based models in the future. For this effort, dedicated identification flight test data is used. This paper first describes the well known Maximum Likelihood frequency domain output error method and the applied physical model briefly. Then, the PBSIDopt method is presented and parameters, which influence the identification process, are discussed. Results from both methods using the same flight test data of the ACT/FHS are compared; model accuracy, order and missing dynamics are investigated. Advantages and disadvantages of both methods are evaluated and the applicability of the PBSIDopt method to rotorcraft system identification and its usage to improve the existing physical model structure is discussed.},

  title = {{{IDENTIFICATION AND SELECTION OF ROTORCRAFT CANDIDATE MODELS TO PREDICT HANDLING QUALITIES AND DYNAMIC STABILITY}}},
  author = {Wartmann, Johannes and Greiser, Steffen},
  date = {2018},
  abstract = {Current frequency-domain system identification methods require an open-loop experiment design for data collection to identify one model of a vehicle. This makes open-loop system identification for unstable systems like rotorcrafts challenging. The optimized Predictor-Based Subspace Identification method also estimates accurate models from closed-loop data. In this paper, a parameter study is conducted to identify a set of bare airframe models of the ACT/FHS research rotorcraft using this subspace method. A selection method is introduced to chose appropriate candidate models from the identified set. The selected candidate models differ slightly in terms of the model invariants and are all a valid approximation of the rotocraft dynamics. Consequently, the selected candidate models can be used to predict the possible properties of the system and their uncertainties. Here, the candidate models are employed to estimate the dynamic stability and handling qualities of the ACT/FHS bare airframe and two control system of the ACT/FHS research rotorcraft.},

  abstract = {To investigate the distinct properties of the helicopter rotors during circling flight, the aerodynamic and dynamic models for the main rotor are established considering the trim conditions and the flight parameters of helicopters. The free wake method is introduced to compute the unsteady aerodynamic loads of the rotor characterized by distortions of rotor wakes, and the modal superposition method is used to predict the overall structural loads of the rotor. The effectiveness of the aerodynamic and the structural methods is verified by comparison with the experimental results, whereby the influences of circling direction, radius, and velocity are evaluated in both aerodynamic and dynamic aspects. The results demonstrate that the circling condition makes a great difference to the performance of rotor vortex, as well as the unsteady aerodynamic loads. With the decrease of the circling radius or the increment of the circling velocity, the thrust of the main rotor increases apparently to balance the inertial force. Meanwhile, the harmonics of aerodynamic loads in rotor disc change severely and an evident aerodynamic load shock appears at high-order components, which further causes a shift-of-peak-phase bending moment in the flap dimension. Moreover, the advancing side of blade experiences second blade/vortex interaction, whose intensity has a distinct enhancement as the circling radius decreases with the motion of vortexes.},
