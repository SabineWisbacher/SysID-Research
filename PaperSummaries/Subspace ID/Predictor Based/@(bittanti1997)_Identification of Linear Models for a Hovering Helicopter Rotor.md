>[!ABSTRACT]-
>Rotor control techniques for active control of vibrations require the availability of dynamic models of the response of the rotor to control inputs. The results of a simulation study of black-box identification trials aiming at the derivation of reduced order, discrete-time , linear models for the response of helicopter rotor loads to individual blade control inputs are presented and discussed. The study has been performed by making use of a simulation program for the dynamics and aerodynamics of the rotor of an existing aircraft, and three identification algorithms have been compared: a frequency domain method and two time domain, subspace based methods.
