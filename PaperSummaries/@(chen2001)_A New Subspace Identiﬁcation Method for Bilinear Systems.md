>[!ABSTRACT]-
>In this paper, asymptotically unbiased subspace algorithms for the identification of bilinear systems are developed. Two three-block subspace algorithms are developed for the deterministic system case and two four-block ones for the combined deterministic-stochastic case. The input signal to the system does not have to be white, which is a major advantage over an existing subspace method for bilinear systems. All the identification algorithms give asymptotically unbiased estimates with general inputs, and the rate of reduction of bias with block size is estimated. Simulation results show that the new algorithms converge much more rapidly (with sample size) than existing methods, and hence are more effective with small sample sizes. The faster convergence is presumably due to the insensitivity of the algorithms to the samplespectrum of the input signal. These advantages are achieved by a new arrangement of the input-output equations into ‘blocks’, and projections onto different spaces than the ones used in earlier methods. A further advantage of our algorithms is that the dimensions of the matrices involved are significantly smaller, so that the computational complexity is lower, though still large.
