>[!ABSTRACT]-
>The wind engineering community relies on multiphysics engineering software to run nonlinear time-domain simulations (e.g., for design-standards-based loads analysis). Although most physics involved in wind energy are nonlinear, linearization of the underlying nonlinear system equations is often advantageous to understand the system properties and exploit well-established methods and tools for analyzing linear systems. This paper presents the development of the new linearization functionality of the open-source engineering tool OpenFAST for floating offshore wind turbines, as well as the concepts and mathematical background needed to understand and apply it.
