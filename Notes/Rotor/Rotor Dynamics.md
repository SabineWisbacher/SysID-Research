# Objectives
- Predict Critical Speed
- Determine Design Modifications to Change Critical Speeds and/or Suppress Dynamic Instabilities
- Predict Amplitudes of Synchronous Vibration Caused by Rotor Imbalance
- Predict Treshold Speeds and Vibration Frequencies for Dynamic Instability

# Natural Frequencies
There are two important maps. The undamped natural frequency map and the damped natural frequency map.

The undamped natural frequency map shows the critical speed for different bearing stiffness of the rotor. Every line represents the critical speed for one mode shape of the rotor. The higher the stiffness the faster the critical speed to activate the mode. For lower stiffness the first two modes are ridgit modes but with higher stiffness they become bending modes.

The damped natural frequency map has the natural frequncies of each mode plottet over the exitation frequency (rotor speed). As the bearing stiffness changes with the exitation frequency the natural frequency is changing for different exitation frequencies.
